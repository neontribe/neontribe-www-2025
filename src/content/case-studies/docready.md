  Comic Relief's 2012 Innovation Labs brought the voice of young people right into the design of services for them to use. Neontribe were one of a consortium who facilitated the labs. Eight of the ideas that came out of that process were selected for funding. One was Docready, which we were chosen to develop. 8 years later, it's still helping hundreds of people every week.
howWeHelped:
  - "Empowered users to remember what they wanted to say to their GP, and how they wanted to say it."
  - "Developed, tested and iterated a digital service with young people."
  - "Balanced user needs for security and functionality with an eye to keeping maintenance very low cost."
  - "Built a tool to last with technologies that wouldn't go out of date."
  - "Collaborated with 3 organisations to deliver the project."
