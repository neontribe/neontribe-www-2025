Alexandra Rose Charity (ARC) is on a mission to address health inequalities and food poverty in the UK. It tackles food inequality directly by giving families access to fresh fruit and vegetables at their local market or greengrocer through the **Rose Vouchers for Fruit & Veg Project**.

ARC needed to scale their service to reach more families. We worked with traders, families, and the staff administering the scheme to understand pain points and develop digital systems to help.

## Challenge

Processing Rose Vouchers involved high volumes of manual work:

- Recording each voucher number and activity on spreadsheets.
- Children's centres keeping distribution records on paper _and_ spreadsheets.
- Market traders manually recording voucher numbers on paper and returning them to ARC.

This information was critical for understanding where and when vouchers were being spent, but the process was extremely time-consuming and error-prone. Generating statistics (e.g., numbers of families, children, traders, and partners) also required manual data entry, reducing accuracy and insight.

## What we did

We worked closely with ARC to understand requirements and built a digital solution that enables the operations team, market traders, and children's centres to scan Rose Vouchers easily. A new mobile app (usable on any handset) streamlines the process and improves data accuracy by removing the potential for human error inherent in manual recording.

## Result

Digitising the process gives ARC a complete view of each voucher's journey:

- When and where a voucher was issued.
- By which trader it was redeemed.
- How long it was in circulation before use.

With richer data and reporting, ARC can better understand:

- Its beneficiaries and overall voucher distribution/usage.
- Which centres or traders process the most transactions.
- Where to apply interventions to help families who may be struggling.
- Potential fraudulent transactions.

ARC can also record how many families receive support from initiatives like Healthy Start, making it easier to provide trackable statistics for local authorities and funders.

### Growth & impact

Since 2014, the number of:

- Traders has increased from 5 to 62.  
- Families has risen from 1,116 to 4,000+ (2023–24).  
- Children's centres has grown from 15 to 73.

Milestones:

- May 2023: 2 million vouchers distributed and spent with 62 traders  
- June 2024: 3 million vouchers distributed  
- The first million took 7 years — the second, only 18 months  

## What ARC says

> "We were concerned that it could become a barrier to new children's centres and traders joining the project."  
> — *Faith Holland, Head of Operations, ARC*

> "The simplified process of scanning the Rose Vouchers using the mobile app means children's centres can register new families much faster… For market traders using the app, payments are generated much faster… Joining up the process for everyone involved means we can support more families than ever before and meet the increasing need for access to fresh fruit and vegetables. For ARC, the data generated is fantastic… a crucial part of our reporting to funders."

> "The digital solution Neontribe developed has allowed ARC to accelerate voucher distribution and manage soaring demand more effectively… we can be confident we can take this service to a larger scale."
