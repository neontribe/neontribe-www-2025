# Introduction

The [Alexandra Rose Charity (ARC)](https://www.alexandrarose.org.uk/) is on a mission to address health inequalities and food poverty in the UK. It tackles food inequality directly by giving families access to fresh fruit and vegetables in their communities at their local market or greengrocer. Its [Rose Vouchers for Fruit and Veg Project](https://www.alexandrarose.org.uk/rose-vouchers/) allows families to redeem vouchers to provide them with access to healthy and affordable food.

But the process of creating and shipping Rose Vouchers to market traders, greengrocers and children's centres was time consuming. And the ARC needed to track each voucher's journey and understand where families needed additional support.

## The Challenge

Processing Rose Vouchers involved high volumes of manual work. Including recording each voucher number and related voucher activities on spreadsheets. Children's centres had to keep distribution records on paper as well as update spreadsheets. And market traders cashing in the vouchers had to manually record the voucher numbers on paper and return them to ARC.

> Faith Holland, Head of Operations at ARC explained how they: "**were concerned that it could become a barrier to new children's centres and traders joining the project.**"

## What We Did

[Neontribe](https://www.neontribe.co.uk/) worked closely with ARC to understand their requirements. We built a digital solution that would enable the operations team, market traders and children centres to easily scan Rose Vouchers. Part of this new digital capability is an app that can be downloaded to any mobile device or handset.

## The Result

Using technology has allowed the charity to fully understand the Rose Voucher journey from start to finish. It's provided important information about:

- when and where the voucher was issued
- by which trader  
- how long it has been in circulation for before the transaction

Since 2014 the number of:
- traders has increased from five to 62
- families has risen from 1116 to supporting over 4000 in 2023-24
- children's centres has multiplied from 15 to 73

> Jonathan Pauling, CEO of the Alexandra Rose Charity, says: "**The digital solution Neontribe developed has allowed ARC to accelerate voucher distribution and manage soaring demand more effectively.**"
