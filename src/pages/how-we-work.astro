    name: "Harry Harrold",
    role: "Head of Neontribe",
    bio: "I helped found Neontribe after a pre-to-post acquisition tour of duty on a fintech start-up. I've discovered you don't need to be able to draw to design, and that life is journeys and pain points. I love to solve the latter and find listening always helps.",

    name: "Neil Dabson",
    role: "Information security and operation officers",
    bio: "As the youngest surviving member of the original founders of Neontribe, I still remember when Norwich didn't have broadband (which was this century). Fortunately, times have moved on and I now help Neontribe and our customers manage Cybersecurity, ISO 27001 and GDPR plus all the other required bureaucracy. As some light relief, I take scouts away on summer camp and help ensure my hobby of live-action role-play runs smoothly by deploying camping and scouting skills in fields throughout the year.",

    name: "Toby Batch",
    role: "Senior Developer",
    bio: "After graduating in computer science in the early 90s I joined an eCommerce startup that was eventually acquired by Sun Microsystems. I was lucky enough to work in Sun's professional services for five years and delivered the iPlanet applications all over the world. After leaving Sun I qualified as a teacher (PGCE) and went on to be one of the founders of Neontribe. Outside of work I hold an ERCA level 2 and coach two age groups of children at Norwich rugby club where all four of my children play.",

  {
    name: "Rachel Harding",
    role: "Interaction designer",
    bio: "On the cusp of beginning a PhD in Psychology, I realised I needed to problem solve in a more visually creative way. Through a couple of intense years dedicating myself to the creative process, I found my passion working in design. At Neontribe, I enjoy the challenge of designing for function and communication, whilst maintaining an artistic look and feel in my work. I deeply care about working on projects for good and hope that I am helping people in a small but meaningful way. Outside of work I can be found climbing, drawing or exploring nature.",

    name: "Charlie Strange",
    role: "Senior Web Engineer",
    bio: "After a decade developing IT capabilities at a sector-leading claims management company Charlie briefly tried his hand directing an SME focused IT services company. He now enjoys writing web things for Good Causes to both pay off karmic debt and explore ways of thinking about software development, mostly in PHP and JS. He's into collaborative storytelling (with dice and cake), poorly defending liberal politics, online security/digital privacy and nursing a mild addiction to certification to bluff his way as an InfoSec pundit. He swims regularly for the secret pleasure of meditating on a problem while the body is on autopilot.",
