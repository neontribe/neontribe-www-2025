# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```


## Project Structure Sample

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/`, is where you can find any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets are in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
